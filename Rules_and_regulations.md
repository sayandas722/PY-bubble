# Rules:
* Put a proper name to your file so that it can be easily accesable
* Put your code under the language folder present in the repository, for example if your code is written in JAVA put it under JAVA folder
* Edit the Index.md file under that particular folder and add your algorithm in the manner the other algorithms are present.
* If the Language you used is not present then make sure you create a folder and add the file in it also create Index.md for easy accesability
* One file should have only one algorithm. If you want to submit more than one algorithm then create separate files.
